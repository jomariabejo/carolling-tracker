# ðŸŽ„ **Carolling Tracker** - A Christmas Fund Tracker with Spring Boot & Vue.js ðŸŽ¶

**Carolling Tracker** is a web-based application to help carolling groups track the money received during their holiday activities. The application allows users to upload donation data in CSV format, display the information in a user-friendly table, and download the updated data. The backend is powered by **Spring Boot**, and the frontend is built using **Vue.js**, making the app both dynamic and easy to use.

## Features

- **Upload CSV**: Easily upload CSV files containing donation records (date, caroller, amount).
- **View Donations**: Display a table of donations and carollers, with the ability to edit data.
- **Export Data**: Download the updated donation data as a CSV file after processing.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Frontend**: Built with Vue.js to provide a dynamic user interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js (for building a reactive and modern user interface)
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java-based backend for handling API requests)
- **Database**: CSV-based storage for simplicity (can be replaced with a database like MySQL or MongoDB)
- **API**: RESTful API (Spring Boot) for communication between backend and frontend
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed on platforms like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Vercel**
